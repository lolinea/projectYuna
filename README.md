The game I made was called Feed Yuna and It was made for my highschool project back in 2022.
The purpose of this game is to get the highest score and It’s a pretty simple game. 
Yuna likes pizza, so click on Yuna with pizza to feed her. 
However, Yuna won’t stay still and will move in a diagonal path. 
Each successful click, the speed increases and Yuna become smaller. 
There are 5 lives, so 5 chances before game is over. 
The game was made with pygame and python.
